#2019 Fantasy Football Depth & Stat Tracker

###Overview

This app enables the user to track NFL team depth charts and stats in the 2019 season to use as a reference for their fantasy football draft(s). It shows per game stats that I believe are some of the most valuable when tracking and ranking players for fantasy drafts.
